## Description
A chatbot project that combines sentiment analysis with response generation using neural networks.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Jaynwabueze/Simple_Chat_bot.git

2. Run the chatbot script: python chatbot.py


## Dataset

The sentiment analysis model is trained using the Topical Chat dataset from Amazon. This dataset consists of over 8000 conversations and over 184000 messages. Each message has a sentiment label representing the emotion of the sender.

## Model Information

The sentiment analysis model is built using a neural network architecture. It involves an embedding layer followed by LSTM layers for sequence processing. The model is trained on the sentiment-labeled messages from the dataset to predict emotions.

## Chatbot

The chatbot component leverages the trained sentiment analysis model to generate contextually appropriate responses. Based on the predicted sentiment of the user input, the chatbot provides empathetic and relevant responses.
